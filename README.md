# Smart-Water-Quality-Monitoring-System

The aim of this project is to develop a Smart Water Quality Monitoring S System for testing the quality of water, using pH, temperature and u turbidity as the parameters, and User-Friendly Real-time Tracking Interface. The collective data is utilized to evaluate the quality of water, and to determine if the water quality is sufficient enough for domestic usage. The main goal is to develop a compact, cost-effective device to measure the appropriate parameters through the respective sensors, that uploads the compressed data to the cloud in a periodic basis, and to develop a Webpage that allows to monitor the quality levels on a real-time basis.
