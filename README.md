# Smart-Water-Quality-Monitoring-System

The aim of this project is to develop a Smart Water Quality Monitoring S System for testing the quality of water, using pH, temperature and u turbidity as the parameters, and a User-Friendly Real-time Tracking I n Interface. The collective data is utilized to evaluate the quality of water, a and to determine if the water quality is sufficient enough for domestic s usage. The main goal is to develop a compact, cost-effective, biosafe e device to measure the appropriate parameters through the respective e sensors, that uploads the compressed data to the cloud in a periodic b a basis, and to develop a Webpage that allows to monitor the quality-l e v levels on a real-time basis.
